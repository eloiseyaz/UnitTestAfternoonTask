# Mercator unit testing afternoon task!

This repo contains the unit testing task.

**Your task is to implement TDD to create an income tax calculator!**

Steps to follow:
1. Write failing tests around the placeholder methods created
2. Run the tests, making sure they fail
3. Write just enough code to make the tests pass
4. Refactor the code to make it cleaner and more readable
---
To run the tests, you can use the green play button in your Spec, or in terminal, run:
```
sbt test
```
----
**Extension task (1 - Hard):**
1. Once all your code is pulled down, branch off main for the hard extension.
2. Refactor the code with the corrected income tax bands, via: https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates
3. When you are happy with your code, tests are passing, create a PR and merge into main. In IntelliJ, checkout main, pull ‘origin main’.
---
**Extension task (2 - Really Hard):**
1. Once all your code is pulled down, branch off main for the really hard extension.
2. Extend the task to calculate total income tax AND capital gains tax from shares. Create a new method that calls your existing methods to accomplish this.
3. Information on implementation can be found: https://taxscouts.com/the-tax-basics/capital-gains-taxrates/
4. When you are happy with your code, tests are passing, create a PR and merge into main. In IntelliJ, checkout main, pull ‘origin main’.
